\abstract {
As quadrotors begin to see extensive use in military and civilian applications, dynamical system models continue to play an important role in platform development, test, and operations.  While traditional Prediction Error Method (PEM) identification techniques struggle to identify MIMO systems, subspace identification methods provide a technique to identify MIMO systems. Common subspace identification methods provide reliable results when identifying systems operating in open loop, but produce biased results when identifying systems operating in the presence of feedback (i.e. closed-loop). The Innovation Estimation Method (IEM) provides an approach to eliminating this bias by pre-estimating the unknown innovation sequence before carrying out subspace identification. We describe the identification of an off-the-shelf quadrotor using experimentally gathered closed-loop input-output data using subspace identification techniques with innovation estimation. We present experimental results illustrating the ability of the identified model to accurately represent 6DOF system dynamics.
