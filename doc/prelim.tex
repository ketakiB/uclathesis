\abstract {
As quadrotors begin to see widespread use in military and civilian applications, accurate dynamical system models continue to play an important role in platform development, test, and operations.  System identification provides an approach to estimating dynamical system models from system input and output data. Subspace system identification methods identify models in their state space form by exploiting the structure of the state space representation. Common subspace identification methods provide reliable results when identifying systems operating in open loop, but produce biased results when identifying systems operating in the presence of feedback (i.e.\ closed-loop systems). The Innovation Estimation Method (IEM) is a subspace identification technique that provides an approach to eliminating this bias by pre-estimating the unknown innovation sequence before carrying out subspace identification. We describe the identification of an off-the-shelf quadrotor using experimentally gathered closed-loop input-output data through subspace identification with innovation estimation. We present experimental results illustrating the ability of a model identified via IEM to accurately represent  system dynamics in the presence of feedback control.
